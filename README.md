## FAQ

#### Q: Why there's two version?

A: Batch version only for windows (which has the first version and batch only exist in windows) and CPP or C++ version is also for windows because idk how to compile to linux executable.

#### Q: How can the first version is batch while you(author) created it with linux?

A: My linux server has wine installed.

#### Q: Why the previous version skips like minecraft 5 block jump ?

A: Because when i'm grounded and decided to make this thing, I thought skipping versions looks cool. But now, I feel very cringe for this decision.

#### Q: Why my anti-virus flag the terminal as a virus while running the batch version?

A: First of all, I didn't sign the executable. Second of all, it is created with Bat2Exe. Third of all, because it is created with Bat2Exe, the executable extract the batch file in %temp% then run it.

#### Q: Why the name?

A: I put the first name that appears in my mind while creating this project. If you want to know the lore, it's basically: atmos, short for atmosphere, terminal. Combine it and become the name. (copied from old README)

#### Q: Can I show off-

A: yes.

#### Q: Can I copy and paste the code and change the name then publish it and claim that I made it?
